/* Aiden and Jonny (Date started= Summer 2018, Date completed 6/19/19): 
 *  Our tactile necklace was created with the goal of allowing a spatially disoriented wearer to be able to better understand his/her position relative to gravity. 
 *  The necklace operates using an accelerometer and gyroscope Arduino microcontroller which transmits data to an Arduino Nano. 
 *  The Nano then interprets the accelerometer/ gyroscope data and converts it into an output in the form of vibrations in the necklace. 
 *  The necklace consists of eight brush motor vibrators that pulsate independently based on the position of the sensor.
